👋 Hi, I’m Jakub — Frontend / Angular Developer

I build modern, scalable web applications with Angular (12–19), RxJS, Signal Store, and NX monorepos.
I work with clean architecture, good development practices, and care strongly about performance and UX.

Currently, I'm developing a full IoT + Cloud system called Squizi — a digital loyalty solution powered by:

- ESP32 devices with NFC, QR and TOTP
- Firmware written in C++
- Angular admin & client applications
- Firebase Cloud Functions, Firestore, RTDB, Auth
- A custom security model based on time-based tokens

This project is private, but feel free to ask me about the architecture — it’s the biggest and most advanced project I’ve built so far.

🔧 Technologies I work with

- Angular 12–19, Standalone Components
- Signal Store, NgRx, RxJS
- TypeScript, JavaScript
- Node.js, Firebase, REST APIs
- NX, Jest, CI/CD, PWA
- ESP32, C++, IoT integrations
- SQL, MongoDB

🏗 What I care about

- Clear and scalable architecture
- Clean, readable code
- Developer experience and team collaboration
- Building products, not just writing code
- Automations, tooling, and testing culture

📌 Public projects

Most of my public repositories are older and come from the early stages of my learning journey — I keep them here for transparency.
My recent commercial and private work (Angular 19 + IoT + Firebase) is hosted in private repositories, but I’m happy to walk through selected pieces during interviews.
